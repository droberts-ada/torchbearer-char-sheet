# Torchbearer Character Sheet

This project is a work-in-progress! It's partly me trying to solve a problem I have, and partly me messing around with React. My style is still evolving rapidly, so forgive any messiness you might encounter.

## Info for Developers

### Vocab

### App Structure

**Roll Page**

The roll page has two types of state. The first is the state provided by the user: toggled options describing how the roll should proceed. The second is called _derived state_, and describes what the roll will look like. Based on what we know about the character and what the user has told us about the roll, how many dice do we get, what are the odds of success, etc.
